### 문제 설명

<p>As you know, escape rooms became very popular since they allow you to play the role of a video game hero. One such room has the following quiz. You know that the locker password is a permutation of N numbers. A permutation of length N is a sequence of distinct positive integers, whose values are at most N. You got the following hint regarding the password - the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at position i equals A<sub>i</sub>. Therefore you want to find the password using these values. As there can be several possible permutations you want to find the lexicographically smallest one. Permutation P is lexicographically smaller than permutation Q if there is an index i such that P<sub>i</sub> < Q<sub>i</sub> and P<sub>j</sub> = Q<sub>j</sub> for all j < i. It is guaranteed that there is at least one possible permutation satisfying the above constraints. Can you open the door?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains one integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>).</p>

<p>The next line contains N space-separated integer A<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤ N).</p>

<p>It’s guaranteed that at least one possible permutation exists. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print in one line the lexicographically smallest permutation that satisfies all the conditions.</p>
