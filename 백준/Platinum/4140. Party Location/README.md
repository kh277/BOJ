### 문제 설명

<p>After the programming contest, all of the contestants would like to throw a party. After the party, however, it will be late, and the contestants will be too tired to walk a long way home. In particular, each contestant refuses to come to the party if it is more than 2.5 km from his or her house.</p>

<p>The solution is to hold the party as close to as many of the contestants' houses as possible. This is where you come in: your job is to determine the optimal location for the party, so that as many contestants as possible will be willing to attend it.</p>

<p>We consider the city to be a flat square, 50 km on each side. A contestant can walk directly from the party in a straight line to his or her house (there are no obstacles).</p>

### 출력
