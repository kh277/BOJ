### 문제 설명

<p>We consider a number to be <em>beautiful</em> if it consists only of the digit 1 repeated one or more times. Not all numbers are beautiful, but we can make any base 10 positive integer beautiful by writing it in another base.</p>

<p>Given an integer N, can you find a base <em>B</em> (with <em>B</em> > 1) to write it in such that all of its digits become 1? If there are multiple bases that satisfy this property, choose the one that maximizes the number of 1 digits.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line with an integer N.</p>

<p>Limits</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 ≤ T ≤ 100.</li>
	<li>3 ≤ N ≤ 1000.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the base described in the problem statement.</p>
